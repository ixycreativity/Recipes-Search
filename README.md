Created a Recipe Search that will search through Edamam's Recipe Search API.
Searches will list up to 10 results as flippable cards in a grid with responsive number of columns.
On one side it shows the recipe title, image and calories.
Clicking on it, it will turn to the back showing an ordered list of ingredients.

This is a React app, run "npm install" after you cloned it, and than "npm start" to view it.
